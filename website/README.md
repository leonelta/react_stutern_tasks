Question 5

The class attribute can be used on any HTML element while You can’t use the word class to define HTML classes, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className. 
  HTML elements have attributes e.g., maxlength in <input maxlength=”16″ /> while SX elements have props e.g., maxLength in <input maxLength=”16″ />
  In HTML almost all tags have an opening and a closing tag except probably a few like  <br/>  while In JSX, however, any element can be written as a self-closing tag, for example: <div/>
Example:
const string = <img src={user.avatarUrl}  />;

Question 6

Browsers can’t read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them. JSX is not intended to be implemented by the engines or browsers, it is intended to be used by various transpilers to transform these JSX into valid JavaScript code
